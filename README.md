__Executive Summary__

This project analyzes growth, retention, and product-category dynamics for Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace, using PostgreSQL for data modeling and analysis and Tableau Public for executive storytelling.

The objective was to move beyond surface-level reporting and answer business-critical questions around how revenue is generated, how dependent the business is on new customers, and where long-term growth opportunities exist.

__Key Findings__

1. Growth is acquisition-led, not value-led
Revenue growth is primarily driven by increasing order volume rather than higher spend per order. Average Order Value (AOV) remains relatively flat over time, indicating limited effectiveness of upsell or pricing strategies.

2. Revenue is highly dependent on one-time customers
Repeat customers contribute less than 6% of total revenue. This reveals weak customer retention and low customer lifetime value, making the growth model heavily reliant on continuous acquisition.

3. Repeat behavior is delayed rather than immediate
Most repeat purchases occur after 60+ days, with minimal repeat activity in the first 30 days following a customer’s first purchase. This suggests weak early engagement and limited habit formation.

4. Customer loyalty is category-dependent
Repeat purchase behavior varies significantly across product categories. Certain consumable and lifestyle categories show strong repeat potential, while many high-volume categories function primarily as one-time purchase drivers.

5. Revenue is highly concentrated across categories
A Pareto analysis shows that a small number of product categories account for the majority of total revenue. Many of these high-revenue categories, however, exhibit low repeat behavior, creating long-term revenue risk.

__Business Implications__

The current growth model is fragile, as it depends heavily on new customer acquisition.

Retention investments should be selective and category-aware, rather than uniformly applied.

High-revenue categories should be optimized for conversion and cross-sell, while high-repeat categories should be scaled to improve customer lifetime value.

Shortening the time to second purchase represents one of the highest-impact levers for sustainable growth.

__Outcome__

This project demonstrates how thoughtful data modeling and analytics can translate raw transactional data into actionable business strategy, balancing short-term revenue optimization with long-term customer value and resilience.

High-revenue categories should be optimized for conversion and cross-sell, while high-repeat categories should be scaled to improve customer lifetime value.

Shortening the time to second purchase represents one of the highest-impact levers for sustainable growth.
